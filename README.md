## Project Overview
This project features an autonomous hexacopter drone designed from scratch for the Teknofest competition by the Geeks Team.<br>
Our team reached the finals and demonstrated the drone's capabilities at Bursa Airport.

## Key Components
- Navio2 Flight Controller<br>
- Raspberry Pi & Pi Camera<br>
- Brushless Motors & ESCs<br>
- LiPo Battery<br>
- 3D-Printed Frame<br>
- GPS Antenna<br>
- RC Receiver and Transmitter<br>
- Telemetry & Mission Planner (laptop)<br>
- Python (DroneKit library)<br>
- Arduino<br>
- Servo Motors<br>


## Project Highlights
The drone operates autonomously, using QR codes for navigation.<br>
It decodes these codes mid-flight to perform tasks such as turning right, landing, or following a predefined path. For example, if a QR code directs the drone to "right," it will turn in that direction; if it reads "task," it will execute the specified task—such as moving up, down, or along a path for a set duration—before returning to its starting point (RTL).
